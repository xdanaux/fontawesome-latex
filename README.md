#fontawesome: high quality web icons#

The **fontawesome** package grants access to 634 web-related icons provided by
the included _Font Awesome_ free font, designed by Dave Gandy and released under
the open SIL Open Font License (available at http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
See http://www.fontawesome.io for more details about the font itself.

This package works both with Xe(La)TeX and Lua(La)TeX (using _fontspec_ to load
the included original otf font), as well as pdf(La)TeX (using an included
type1 conversion and character mapping of the font).

Once the package is loaded, icons can be accessed through the general `\faicon`
command, which takes as argument the name of the desired icon, or through direct
commands specific to each icon. The full list of icon designs, names and direct
commands is showcased in the manual.
